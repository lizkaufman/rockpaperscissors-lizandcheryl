# Rock, Paper, Scissors

Hosted at: https://rockpaperscissors-soc.netlify.com/ 

Made during my first two weeks of the School of Code bootcamp, this humble little rock, paper, scissors game was my first full project tying together my burgeoning knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It definitely has that "first project" look, but I'm really proud of it regardless. 

Through it, I learned how to use JavaScript to create a truly dynamic website with functions, event listeners, and information stored in variables and displayed on the DOM. 

In terms of styling, I cemented my basic CSS skills along with taking my first foray into flexbox.
